******************************************************************
Abidar is a task scheduling system for ASP.NET that uses XML
configuration and a level of abstraction to execute different
tasks on a regular basis in ASP.NET applications without requiring
any access to Windows services or other system resources. This
library can be used easily in all hosting environments such as
shared solutions.
